# PyGPACalculator
This is a GPA Calculator which is a command-line tool that allows users to calculate their grade point average (GPA) based on their course grades and credit hours. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.

At its core, this GPA Calculator is a Python script that takes input from the user (currently through a file) and performs the necessary calculations to determine their GPA. The user inputs their course grades and credit hours, and the script calculates their weighted average and displays their GPA on the terminal.

### To run the script:
- Open terminal
- Make sure you have python installed by runnning:
```
python -V
```
- Access the folder where you have downloaded the script using the following command
  - You can also use your file manager to copy and paste the file location from the address bar
```
cd (location of file)
```
- Run:
```
python main.py
```

# WARNING:
- I do not gaurantee that this will give you your actual GPA. However I did test 
 this method with past grades and it work successfully.
- I am not responsible for any problems that occur from this program, it is 
 only used to get your approximate current GPA in a more easier and efficient way.
- This is still a work in progress
